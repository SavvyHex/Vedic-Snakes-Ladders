# Vedic Snakes & Ladders — React + Phaser

This repository was converted from a vanilla JS Phaser project into a React + Vite project.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs at the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes

- Phaser game logic has been embedded in `src/components/PhaserGame.jsx`.
- Level data is in `src/data/levelData.js`.
